# croque

An experimental implementation of a durable queue [component] (https://github.com/stuartsierra/component), i.e. a queue where entries can be replayed from a
previous point in time (if not intentionally expunged). This is simply a wrapper around the [Chronical Queue] (http://chronicle.software/products/chronicle-queue/) and only
exposes some basic functionality required for evaluating its usage as an [Event Storage] (http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) replacement for [Kafka]
(http://kafka.apache.org/) in an embedded application scenario.


[![croque version](http://clojars.org/croque/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/croque)


## Configuration

The queue is configured by starting the component with a configuration map.

Sample configuration with all available options:
```clj
{
 ;; Path on the file system where the queue information is persisted.
 ;; This is a mandatory parameter.
 :path "./data"

 ;; Optional parameter to control the rolling period i.e. when new data files are created.
 ;; The default value is :DAILY what results in a new data files created every day.
 ;; Other possible values are amongst others: :TEST_SECONDLY, :MINUTELY, :HOURLY.
 ;; See also:
 ;; https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue/blob/HEAD/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/queue/RollCycles.java
 :roll-cycle :DAILY

 ;; Optional parameter to specify the number data files to be retained. Older cycle files are deleted.
 ;; If this option is not specified, no persisted data is deleted and the history is kept forever
 ;; (as long there is disk space). Thus, the duration how long back in time the queue can replayed  
 ;; depends on the number cycles retained and what the roll-cycle period is configured.
 ;; Example: If the roll cycle is set to :DAILY and :retain-cycles has the value 10, the queue will keep
 ;; entries from the last 10 days.
 :retain-cycles 10
}
```

## Usage

```clj
;; Get some dependencies
> (require '[com.stuartsierra.component :as component])
> (require '[croque.core :as croque])

;; Create and start a CroqueQueue component, persisting the queue entries
;; under the local directory './data'
> (def queue (component/start (croque/new-croque-queue {:path "./data"})))

;; Add some example entries to the queue
;; Every call will return the index position of the inserted entry
> (croque/append-entry! queue [:example {:entry 0}])
> (croque/append-entry! queue [:example {:entry 1}])
> (croque/append-entry! queue [:example {:entry 2}])

;; Read entries from the queue
> (croque/next-entry queue)
;;=> [:example {:entry 0}]
> (croque/next-entry queue)
;;=> [:example {:entry 1}]
> (croque/next-entry queue)
;;=> [:example {:entry 2}]

;; Get the current read position (index)
;; The returned index number will be different when you execute this
;; command. The index number is built by combining the cycle number
;; (normally representing days) and the sequence number, the "number
;; of added entry", so to speak
> (:last-index-appended (croque/appender-state queue))
;;=> 73164767887365

;; Add an additional entry (returns the insert index position)
> (croque/append-entry! queue [:example {:entry 3}])

;; Rewind tailer two entries
> (croque/rewind queue 2)
> (croque/next-entry queue)
;;=> [:example {:entry 1}]

;; Check current read position (sequence number)
> (:sequence (croque/tailer-state queue))
;;=> 2

;; Set the new read position by sequence number
> (croque/seek-sequence-position queue 3)
> (croque/next-entry queue)
;;=> [:example {:entry 3}]

;; Set the new read position by the index obtained before
> (croque/seek-index-position queue 73164767887365)
> (croque/next-entry queue)
;;=> [:example {:entry 2}]
